# School on The Farm Launch Site
### User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project for Code Institute

**_This is a website designed for a real business & a real client. Business name, logo & location have been changed for the purposes of this submission_**

A launch website for a new outdoor nursery school business. My client was seeking a website to advertise the launch of her new small business. The business was a nursery school offering childcare for 0-5s in an outdoor setting. There is significant competition around childcare provision in the local area so the site had to showcase the advantages of this new business over others (e.g. children looked after outside on a farm setting). I have created the content based on discussions & a business plan supplied by the client.

The intention is that this single page launch site will be replaced by a more comprehensive website once the business is up & running (with styles and branding carried through).

## Demo

The site can be found live here.

## UX

The goal of this site was to provide a simple but eye-catching landing page for potential customers. The site had to deliver the key information about the nursery and provide a means for parents/carers to sign up for more info / pre-registration. Visitors would be directed to the site from advertising via print media, word of mouth & social networks.

I have chosen to use a single page layout as this feels more straightforward for users and alludes to a small, modern business.

### User Stories

1. Potential customers arriving at the site are engaged by the content, agree with the philosophy and easily find all the information they need to convince them to complete the sign up for further information.
2. Other interested parties (e.g. local authority, Ofsted etc.) that are informed about the new business can look up the site & find basic info about it as well as clear contact details for the responsible person.
3. Users experience coordinated branding across the site and other media which creates good user experience and confidence in the business.
